More Dirty Dancing (full title: More Dirty Dancing: More Original Music from the Hit Motion Picture) is a follow-up album to the soundtrack to the 1987 film Dirty Dancing. It was released on March 4, 1988, by RCA Records,[1] and made it to number three on both the US and the UK albums charts.  "Do You Love Me", a 1962 Contours hit that features prominently in the film and appears on More Dirty Dancing, was re-issued as a single and became a hit for a second time, peaking at number eleven on the Billboard Hot 100 in August 1988.
David Handelman of Rolling Stone gave the album one star out of five, calling some of the tracks "instrumental idiocies".[1] Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic gave it two out of five stars saying that the follow-up contained "nothing more than a pleasant collection of oldies and faceless MOR adult contemporary pop".[2]
