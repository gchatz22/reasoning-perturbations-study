With his comedy partner Carrie Brownstein, he co-created and co-starred in the IFC sketch comedy series Portlandia. He also co-created and starred in the mockumentary IFC series Documentary Now! and the Showtime comedy series Moonbase 8.
Armisen was the bandleader and frequent drummer for the Late Night with Seth Meyers house band, the 8G Band from 2014 to 2024. He is known as a cast member on the late-night sketch comedy and variety series Saturday Night Live from 2002 to 2013. He also voiced Speedy Gonzales on The Looney Tunes Show.
Armisen has acted in comedy films, including EuroTrip, Melvin Goes to Dinner, The Ex, and The Dictator. He is also notable for his guest-star appearances in television shows such as 30 Rock, Parks and Recreation, Brooklyn Nine-Nine, New Girl, Broad City, Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt, Difficult People, The Last Man on Earth, Toast of London, Curb Your Enthusiasm, Modern Family, and Barry.
Armisen received a Grammy Award nomination for Best Comedy Album for Standup for Drummers in 2019. He has also won two Peabody Awards, one in 2008 as part of the Saturday Night Live political satire cast[2] and one in 2011 for Portlandia.[3] From 2019 to 2022, he co-starred and served as writer and executive producer on the Spanish-language series Los Espookys, which he co-created.
Armisen was born in Hattiesburg, Mississippi, on December 4, 1966, the son of schoolteacher Hildegardt Mirabal Level and IBM employee Fereydun Herbert Armisen.[4] He moved with his family to New York as a baby,[5] and briefly lived in Brazil in his youth. He was raised in Valley Stream, New York,[5] where he was a classmate of fellow SNL alumnus Jim Breuer.[6] He attended the School of Visual Arts in Manhattan[7] before dropping out to begin a career as a rock drummer.[5] He said that he was inspired to perform after seeing the Clash and Devo perform on television, and wanted to be a performer since he was a child.[8]
Armisen's mother was Venezuelan, born in San Fernando de Apure,[9][10][11] while his father was born in Soltau to a German mother and Korean father.[11][12] For much of his life, Armisen thought his paternal grandfather Ehara Masami was Japanese. However, Masami (better known by his professional name Masami Kuni or birth name Park Yeong-in[11][13]) was actually Korean and came from Ulsan; he adopted a Japanese name and persona after the massacre of Koreans in 1923 when he was a high school student.[14][11] Park studied aesthetics at Tokyo Imperial University and became a professional dancer before moving to Germany.[15][13] After the war, he returned to Japan, and formed a premier modern dance company. He eventually emigrated to the US, where he taught dance at what is now Cal State Fullerton from 1964 to 1975.[13][12] Park Yeong-in's family were members of the Korean aristocracy, and Armisen's Korean lineage can be verifiably traced back to the 1600s.[12]
In 1984, Armisen played drums in a local band along with his high school friends in Valley Stream, New York, but the group soon ended. In 1988, he moved to Chicago to play drums for the punk rock band Trenchmouth,[16] and in the 1990s he played background drums with Blue Man Group.
Armisen played drums on three tracks for Les Savy Fav's 2007 album Let's Stay Friends,[17] as well as tracks for Matthew Sweet's 2011 album Modern Art[18] and Wandering Lucy's 1996[19] album Leap Year.[18]
Armisen is the music director and frequent drummer[20] of the 8G Band, the house band for Late Night with Seth Meyers, since February 24, 2014.[21] However, the band was laid off at the end of the 2023–2024 season due to budget cuts from NBC. They will still pre-record music for the show, but will not perform live.[22]
In 2018, Armisen played drums as part of Devo at John Waters' Burger Boogaloo festival in Oakland, California.[23][24]
In July 2021, he performed at the Newport Folk Festival in Rhode Island.[25]
While not playing with the band Trenchmouth, Armisen's interests switched to acting. In a January 2006 interview, he said, "I wanted to be on TV somehow. For some reason, I always thought it would be an indirect route; I didn't know that it would be comedy and Saturday Night Live. I just wanted to do something with performing that would lead me there."[26]
Armisen's subsequent television work, such as some "memorable Andy Kaufman–esque appearances"[27] on Late Night with Conan O'Brien, as well as work for Crank Yankers and Adult Swim, led to a role in 2002 as a featured player in the cast of Saturday Night Live.[27] In the 2004 season, he was promoted to repertory cast member.
Armisen has landed several minor yet memorable roles that were defined by an interviewer as "feral foreigners"[28] in comedy films such as Eurotrip, Deuce Bigalow: European Gigolo, Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy, Deck the Halls, The Ex, The Promotion, The Rocker, Tenacious D in The Pick of Destiny, and Confessions of a Shopaholic, Cranky Kong's voice on Super Mario Brothers movie.
Further television work included an appearance on Parks and Recreation in the 2009 episode "Sister City".[29] For the Cartoon Network series The Looney Tunes Show (2011–2014), Armisen voices Speedy Gonzales. He and fellow Saturday Night Live alums Bill Hader and Seth Meyers write, produce, and star in the IFC mockumentary series Documentary Now![30] which premiered in 2015.
Armisen starred in the IFC sketch series Portlandia alongside Carrie Brownstein (of Sleater-Kinney); the first season debuted on January 21, 2011.[31] With Brownstein, he appeared on the 2012 Simpsons episode "The Day the Earth Stood Cool", in which they play the Simpsons' new neighbors, who encourage everyone to be cool like them.[32][33]
Since 2014, Armisen has been music director and sometimes bandleader and drummer on Late Night with Seth Meyers, for which he received positive reviews for his deadpan comedy and especially for his interplay with the host.[34]
For his work on Portlandia, Armisen was nominated for an Emmy Award for Outstanding Writing for a Variety Series in 2012, 2013, and 2014[35] and for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series in 2014.
In 2021, Armisen was executive producer on the documentary Charm Circle, directed by Nira Burstein.[36]
In 2022, he appeared in Wednesday as Uncle Fester.[37]
in 2024 he appeared as FDA representative Mike Puntz in Jerry Seinfeld’s Unfrosted. 
Armisen joined the cast of Saturday Night Live in 2002.[38] He was promoted to a repertory player in 2004. After 11 years as a cast member, he decided to leave the show. At the time of his 2013 departure from the show,[39][40] Armisen was the third-longest-tenured cast member (behind Seth Meyers and Darrell Hammond), and he appeared in the second-highest number of sketches (856) of any cast member. Since then, Armisen has come back for multiple cameo appearances on the show, including when he hosted the season 41 finale on May 21, 2016, with musical guest Courtney Barnett.

But the greatest impersonation he does is that of a normal person."[57] During a later interview with Howard Stern, Armisen said, "I think I was a terrible husband. I think I'm a terrible boyfriend. [...] I feel bad for everyone I've gone out with."[57]
Armisen started dating actress Natasha Lyonne in 2014.[58][59] Lyonne confirmed that they had ended their relationship in April 2022: "We love each other just about as much as two people can love each other and we're still talking all the time."[60] Armisen began dating and married comedian Riki Lindhome later that year, and they purchased a home together in Los Feliz.[61]
Since working together on ThunderAnt, Armisen and Carrie Brownstein developed what Brownstein has called "one of the most intimate, functional, romantic, but nonsexual relationships [they have] ever had".[62] According to Armisen, their relationship is "all of the things that I've ever wanted, you know, aside from like the physical stuff, but the intimacy that I have with her is like no other".[63]
