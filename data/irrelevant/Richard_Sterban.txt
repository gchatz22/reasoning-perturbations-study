Prior to joining the Oak Ridge Boys, Sterban toured with J. D. Sumner and the Stamps Quartet, who were singing backup for Elvis Presley at that time. Sterban ultimately became best known for his "oom-pa-pa-oom-pa-pa-moww-moww" bass solo in the Oak Ridge Boys' 1981 single "Elvira" and sang lead vocals on a select few of the group's songs, including a cover of the Righteous Brothers' hit "Dream On", which was a top-ten hit.
Sterban has recorded public service announcements for NOAA Weather Radio. He served as the voice of The Roadhouse, the classic country Sirius Satellite Radio channel. Sterban was a minority owner of the Nashville Sounds minor league baseball team from 1978 to 2008, along with entrepreneur Larry Schmittou and other country music stars, such as Conway Twitty, Larry Gatlin, and Cal Smith.[3]
Since 2023, Sterban has taken prolonged absences from the Oak Ridge Boys' tours. Aaron McCune, the bass vocalist for Dailey & Vincent, serves as Sterban's designated fill-in. As of September 2023, the band has stated that the issues that led to Sterban's absences have been resolved.[4]
