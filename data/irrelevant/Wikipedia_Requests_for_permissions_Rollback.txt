Hey, I was granted a 3-month trial by Robertsky, and I used Anti-Vandal to counter vandalism. However, it was not renewed. Now I would like to continue using this amazing tool to counter vandalism. Thanks. GrabUp - Talk 14:27, 16 November 2024 (UTC)[reply]
I am requesting rollback rights to further help with my contribution to anti-vandalism, with I having done actions to prevent vandalism on pages like Johnny Somali and Islamic State-related articles. RowanJ LP (talk) 04:34, 20 November 2024 (UTC)[reply]
I would like to cautiously begin assisting in identifying and removing vandalism. Thanks. WhyIAddA (talk) 20:04, 20 November 2024 (UTC)[reply]
I am a newpage editor with autopatrol approval. I have been monitoring the Recent Chane list working to revert mainly vandalism while continuing to maintain my own editing. Demt1298 (talk) 15:10, 21 November 2024 (UTC)[reply]
Ever since I became active on Wikipedia, my main interest has been combatting vandalism. With over a month of experience patrolling recent changes, I would therefore like to apply for rollback to better assist with the project, potentially utilizing tools such as Huggle.

I have been patrolling recent changes on-and-off for around 6 months now. Been looking to try out tools like Huggle or AV to replace the manual "ctrl+clicking diff links on recent changes and seeing if they're bad". I have read the necessary pages, and I understand how rollback may be used. mwwv converseâˆ«edits 18:25, 22 November 2024 (UTC)[reply]
