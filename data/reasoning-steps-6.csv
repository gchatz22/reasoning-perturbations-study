0,John builds a box.  The box is 26 inches by 26 inches by 14 inches.  The walls are 1 inch thick on each side.  How much is the internal volume in cubic feet?,"The walls take away 2*1=<<2*1=2>>2 inches from each dimension
So the longer sides are 26-2=<<26-2=24>>24 inches
That is 24/12=<<24/12=2>>2 feet
The smaller dimension is 14-2=<<14-2=12>>12 inches
That is 12/12=<<12/12=1>>1 foot
So the internal volume is 2*2*1=<<2*2*1=4>>4 cubic feet

1,"Markus is twice the age of his son, and Markus's son is twice the age of Markus's grandson.  If the sum of the ages of Markus, his son, and his grandson is 140 years, then how many years old is Markus's grandson?","Let ""x"" be the age of Markus's grandson.
If Markus's son is twice the age of Markus's grandson, then Markus's son is 2*x.
If Markus is twice the age of his son, then Markus is 2*2*x.
Therefore, if the sum of the ages of Markus, his son, and his grandson is 140 years, then x+(2*x)+(2*2*x)=140 years.
Simplifying the equation, we see that 7*x=140 years.
Therefore, the age of Markus's grandson is x=20 years old.

2,"There are twice as many cows as dogs at a petting farm. If there are currently 184 cows at the farm, and the farm owner decides to sell 1/4 of the cows and 3/4 of the dogs, how many animals are remaining on the farm?","If there are 184 cows, twice the number of dogs, then there are 184/2 =<<184/2=92>>92 dogs on the farm.
When the farm owner decided to sell 1/4 of cows, he sold 1/4*184 = 46 cows
The total number of cows remaining on the farm is 184-46 = <<184-46=138>>138
If the farm owner also sold 3/4 of the dogs, he sold 3/4*92 = <<3/4*92=69>>69
The total number of dogs remaining on the farm is 92-69 = <<92-69=23>>23
The total number of animals remaining on the farm is 23+138 = <<23+138=161>>161
