0,"Tony has a bucket that holds 2 pounds of sand. He has a sandbox out back that is two feet deep, four feet wide, and 5 feet long. A cubic foot of sand weighs 3 pounds. Because it's hot outside, he wants to make sure he stays hydrated, so every 4 trips he takes he drinks 3 ounces of bottled water. A 15 ounce bottle of water costs $2. He has $10 with him. How much change will he have after he buys all the water he needs?","The sandbox is 40 cubic feet because 2 x 4 x 5 = <<2*4*5=40>>40
He needs 120 pounds of sand because 40 x 3 = <<40*3=120>>120
He will take 60 trips because 120 / 2 = <<120/2=60>>60
He will need to drink water 15 times because 60 / 4 = <<60/4=15>>15
He will drink 45 ounces of water because 15 x 3 = <<15*3=45>>45
He will need 3 bottles of water because 45 / 15 = <<45/15=3>>3
He will spend $6 on water because 3 x 2 = <<3*2=6>>6
He will have $4 in change because 10 - 6 = <<10-6=4>>4
