>>> Question: Three friends: Mike, Jim, and Tony decided to play a game. After 3 rounds Mike has 21 points, Jim 3 points less than Mike, and Tony 2 times more than Mike. In the fourth round, every player gets an extra point if they have over 20 points. How many points do all three players have in total after the extra points had been distributed?
>>> Correct Answer: After 3 rounds Jim has 21 points - 3 points = <<21-3=18>>18 points.
Tony has 2 times more points than Mike, so he has 2 * 21 points = <<2*21=42>>42 points.
In total they have 42 points + 18 points + 21 points = <<42+18+21=81>>81 points.
Only two of them have over 20 points, so in total, all friends have 81 points + 2 points = <<2+81=83>>83 points.
#### 83
>>> Baseline Answer: Let's solve this step by step:

1. Mike's points before the 4th round: 21 points
2. Jim's points before the 4th round: 21 - 3 = 18 points
3. Tony's points before the 4th round: 21 × 2 = 42 points

4. Extra point distribution:
   - Mike gets an extra point (over 20 points)
   - Jim does not get an extra point (under 20 points)
   - Tony gets an extra point (over 20 points)

5. Points after the extra round:
   - Mike: 21 + 1 = 22 points
   - Jim: 18 points
   - Tony: 42 + 1 = 43 points

6. Total points after the extra round:
   22 + 18 + 43 = 83

####83
>>> Answer in relevant experiment: Let's solve this step by step:

1. Mike's points after 3 rounds: 21 points
2. Jim's points: 21 - 3 = 18 points
3. Tony's points: 21 × 2 = 42 points

4. Extra point distribution:
   - Mike has over 20 points, so he gets an extra point
   - Jim does not have over 20 points, so no extra point
   - Tony has over 20 points, so he gets an extra point

5. Final points:
   - Mike: 21 + 1 = 22 points
   - Jim: 18 points
   - Tony: 42 + 1 = 43 points

6. Total points after extra points:
   22 + 18 + 43 = 83

>>> Question: I have 10 liters of orange drink that are two-thirds water and I wish to add it to 15 liters of pineapple drink that is three-fifths water. But as I pour it, I spill one liter of the orange drink. How much water is in the remaining 24 liters?
>>> Correct Answer: There are 15 x 3/5 = <<15*3/5=9>>9 liters of water from the 15 liters pineapple drink.
After 1 liter of orange drink was spilled, there were 10 - 1 = <<10-1=9>>9 liters of orange drink left.
Out of the 9 liters, 9 x 2/3 = <<9*2/3=6>>6 liters are water.
Thus, there are a total of 9 + 6 = <<9+6=15>>15 liters of water out of the 24 liters.
#### 15
>>> Baseline Answer: Let's solve this step by step:

1. Orange drink (initially 10 liters):
   - Total volume: 10 liters
   - Water content: 2/3 * 10 = 6.67 liters
   - After spilling 1 liter: 9 liters total
   - Water content becomes: 2/3 * 9 = 6 liters

2. Pineapple drink (15 liters):
   - Total volume: 15 liters
   - Water content: 3/5 * 15 = 9 liters

3. Combined drink after mixing:
   - Total volume: 9 (orange) + 15 (pineapple) = 24 liters
   - Total water: 6 (orange) + 9 (pineapple) = 15 liters

Therefore, the total water in the 24-liter mixture is 15 liters.

####15
>>> Answer in relevant experiment: Let's solve this step by step:

1. Orange drink (initial):
- Total volume: 10 liters
- Water content: 2/3 of 10 = 6.67 liters
- After spilling 1 liter, remaining volume is 9 liters
- Remaining water: (6.67/10) * 9 = 6 liters

2. Pineapple drink:
- Total volume: 15 liters
- Water content: 3/5 of 15 = 9 liters

3. Combined mixture:
- Total volume: 9 (orange) + 15 (pineapple) = 24 liters
- Total water: 6 (orange) + 9 (pineapple) = 15 liters

The water content in the 24-liter mixture is 15 liters.
