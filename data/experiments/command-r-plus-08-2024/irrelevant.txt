>>> Question: Adam wants to eat some sliced apples. A large apple can be sliced into 5 pieces, and a small apple can be sliced into 3 pieces. Adam decides to slice 3 large and 5 small apples and then eats 15 slices. How many apple slices are left?
>>> Correct Answer: There are 3*5=<<3*5=15>>15 large apple slices.
There are 5*3=<<5*3=15>>15 small apple slices.
In total, there are 15+15=<<15+15=30>>30 apple slices.
After Adam eats 15 slices, there are 30-15=<<30-15=15>>15 apple slices remaining.
#### 15
>>> Baseline Answer: Adam slices 3 large apples into 3 x 5 = 15 pieces.
He also slices 5 small apples into 5 x 3 = 15 pieces.
So, he has a total of 15 + 15 = 30 slices.
After eating 15 slices, he has 30 - 15 = 15 slices left.

>>> Question: Mark is trying to choose between two venues for a surprise party for his wife.  The first venue charges a flat fee of $200, regardless of how many guests attend.  While the second charges, $25 per person who attends.  However, the first venue does not include food, which Mark estimates will cost $5 for each person who attends.  At the second venue, food for each guest is already included in the price.  How many guests are necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost?
>>> Correct Answer: The total cost of the first venue can be expressed as 200 + 5*X, where X is the number of guests. Similarly, the total cost of the second venue can be expressed as 25*X.
Next we must find the value of X that makes these two costs equal. Setting these two expressions equal to each other, we get the equation 200 + 5*X = 25*X.
By subtracting 5*X from each side to get 200 = 20*X.
Then, X = 200/20 = 10, so when there are 10 guests the two venues will be equal in cost.
#### 10
>>> Baseline Answer: The cost of the first venue is $200 plus $5 per person, so for $N$ people, the cost is $200 + $5N$.

The cost of the second venue is $25 per person, so for $N$ people, the cost is $25N$.

Setting these equal to each other, we get:

$$
\begin{equation*}
200 + 5N = 25N \, .
\end{equation*}
$$

Subtracting $5N$ from both sides and simplifying:

$$
\begin{align*}
200 & = 20N \\
10 & = N \, .
\end{align*}
$$
