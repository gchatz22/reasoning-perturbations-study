>>> Question: Marisa gets $5 as pocket money every day from her parents. She buys 4 lollipops worth 25 cents each every day and saves the change in her piggy bank. How much money does she put in her piggy bank if she saves for 5 days?
>>> Correct Answer: If each lollipop costs 25 cents, 4 lollipops cost 4 * 25 cents = <<4*25=100>>100 cents
Since 100 cents = $1 she spends $1 everyday.
Her savings everyday is $5 - $1 = $<<5-1=4>>4
If she saves $4 every day for 5 days, she will have $4 * 5 = $<<4*5=20>>20

>>> Baseline Answer: Marisa receives $5 every day as pocket money. She spends 4 lollipops worth 25 cents each, which totals to 4 * $0.25 = $1.00 spent on lollipops daily. Therefore, the amount she saves each day is $5.00 - $1.00 = $4.00. Over 5 days, she saves 5 * $4.00 = $20.00.

>>> Question: Mark's car breaks down and he needs to get a new radiator.  The cost for a new radiator is $400 but he goes to get it at a junk shop and gets it for 80% off.  He then hires a mechanic to install it and it takes 3 hours at $50 an hour.  How much did he pay?
>>> Correct Answer: The discount on the radiator was 400*.8=$<<400*.8=320>>320
So he paid 400-320=$<<400-320=80>>80
The mechanic charges 3*50=$<<3*50=150>>150
So in total he paid 80+150=$<<80+150=230>>230
#### 230
>>> Baseline Answer: First, calculate the cost of the radiator with the 80% discount. The original price is $400, and the discount is 80%, so he pays 20% of the original price.

Cost of the radiator = 20% of $400 = 0.20 * $400 = $80

Next, calculate the cost of hiring the mechanic. The mechanic charges $50 per hour and works for 3 hours.

Cost of mechanic = 3 hours * $50/hour = $150

Finally, add the cost of the radiator and the mechanic to find the total amount Mark paid.

Total cost = Cost of the radiator + Cost of mechanic = $80 + $150 = $230
